# remove-image-backgrounds


This code implements a web application using Streamlit to remove backgrounds from images. Upon startup, it allows users to upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format, which is saved in a directory called "uploads." It then utilizes the rembg library to eliminate the background and generates a new PNG file. The interface displays both the original and processed images, along with download buttons for each. If an error occurs during processing, an error message is shown. In summary, it provides an easy and visual way to remove backgrounds from images.
